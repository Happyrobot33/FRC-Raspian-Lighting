RobotTime - This is how long the robot has been enabled for, counting up since auton enable
AutonSelection - 1-3 based on what auton is being used. Technically not needed if I can look at what the sendable chooser has instead, since it is already on the table
Intake_Flag - Set to 1 if intaking, otherwise 0
Shooting_Flag - Set to 1 if shooting, otherwise 0
Outtake_Flag - Set to 1 if outtaking, otherwise 0
Velocity - set to whatever the robots current velocity is, 0 for no velocity
MaxVelocity - set to whatever the robots theoretical max velocity is
Climber_Flag - sent when the lower limit switch is no longer active
