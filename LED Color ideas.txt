Robot LED Color Coding Ideas
No Connection - Flashing Purple
Upon FMS Connection - Bumpers go Green
Upon Driver Station Connection - Intake goes green, followed by the whole robot then fading to our alliance color

Autonomous:
For each individual autonomous mode, have a specific color pattern
Also show the remaining Autonomous time on the bumper strips, decreasing
1 Ball Auton - Purple with a single 6 pixel yellow strip in the middle
2 Ball Normal - Purple with two 6 pixel yellow strips in the middle
2 Ball Short - Purple with three 6 pixel yellow strips in the middle
These also need to update continously as they are changed by the driverstation

Teleop:
idle - Purple Bumpers, Yellow Intake???
Continous affect - Percentage fill from 0 to max speed, showing the robots current velocity on the bumpers
On Pickup - Strobe the intake so it has a "pulling" Pattern up its length
On Shoot - Charge affect, followed by a percentage fill to make it look like it is "Pushing" the balls out
On Puke - Strobe the intake so it has a "Pushing" Pattern down its length
On Climb Detect - Something flashy?????? Unknown, possibly something integrating the current alliance color

Other:
Warning system - Possibly integrating a system to flash colors at ~40 seconds to indicate it is time to climb
Countdown to match end - Possibly have a countdown visible on the robot as the match is ending, once we have climbed
On Disable / Match end - Revert to alliance color with sliding purple strips???

This is all feasible, just have to figure out exactly what we want to do
Would also like to implement fading between every animation, if possible
