# FRC-Raspian-Lighting
 
## Planned Rewrite
Use https://github.com/retejs/rete for node editing, https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_LED_Animation for built in animation handling to avoid the framerate issues that were encountered. Have the pi host the rete webserver so you can connect to the robot and modify it easily
